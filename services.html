           <h2>Riso Printing??</h2>
           <p>Risograph is a print process which combines the best of digital
           and traditional print: a hand-made look and feel with the speed,
           low-cost and efficiency of a modern printer. Though it looks on the
           outside like a copy machine, the Risograph is not a copier.
           It is a duplicator (think mimeograph) with a process like screen printing.
           The Riso duplicator internally creates a stencil that is laid onto a
           drum filled with ink. The drum then spins at high speed, forcing the
           ink through the stencil onto the paper, where it is absorbed creating
           a unique look and texture.</p>

           <h2>Riso Quirks...</h2>
           <p>
             Risograph Printing is a digital duplicator process that has unique
             characteristics and always contains slight imperfections. These include:
             <ul>
               <li><p><b>Smudging.</b> Risograph ink is made from a combination of environmentally
                 friendly soy oil, water and pigment, the prints are reminiscent of
                 newspaper ink and it is possible to smudge the ink.</p></li>
               <li><p><b>Uneven coverage.</b> Large flat areas of solid ink coverage are
                 likely to show some slight variations, which can include pinholes
                 and flooding.</li>
               <li><p><b>Registration.</b> Riso is like screen printing in that each ink
                  color is layered on separately. A single piece of paper will run
                  through our machines several times for multi-color projects and the
                  overlap of colors can be irregular.</p></li>
               <li><p><b>Tire marks.</b> When a paper is fed through the machine
                 multiple times and it is heavily inked, the paper feeder rollers
                 may leave tire marks on the pages face or end sheets.</p></li>
             </ul>
           </p>

           <br />
           <br />
