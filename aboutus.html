          <h2 style="text-align: left;">Keith Truong</h2>
          <p>
            Keith Truong is a multi-disciplinary artist born and raised
            in Saigon, Vietnam, currently based in Boston, Massachusetts.
            Keith's work involves digital 3D modeling, graphic design, and
            print media. They are heavily influenced by cinematic themes and
            the sequencing of images. They seek to explore identity,
            relationships, and how varying interpretation can inform and
            transform both the thematic and technical qualities of their work.
